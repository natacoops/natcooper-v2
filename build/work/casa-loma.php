							<p>While I was in University, I worked as a tour guide during the summer. I frequently spoke with tourists about attractions all across Toronto - but when it came to Casa Loma I had a hard time finding information on their <a class="bodyLink" href="http://casaloma.org/" target="_blank">current site</a>.</p>
							<p>I recently took it upon myself to reimagine the site if it had a modern, elegant design to attract visitors. I had fun researching the design trends from the turn of the century (the era that the castle was built). I quickly fell in love with the "steampunk" aesthetic and designed the Casa Loma wordmark in that style.</p>

							<p>Their current site has an image slider at the top with rich photography - although this is eye-catching, I think including their <a class="bodyLink" href="https://instagram.com/casalomatoronto/" target="_blank">instagram</a> photos is a nicer option, especially since their account is so active. The high-res photos would of course still be included in a gallery on a sub-page.</p>
