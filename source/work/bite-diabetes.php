							<p><a class="bodyLink" href="https://twitter.com/bitediabetes">Tannis Cohen</a> is a human rights lawyer, former CBC restaurant reviewer and ultimate foodie. On top of all that, she is also a joy to work with, and I know first hand that her food is delicious!</p>
							<p>Bite Diabetes is a custom wordpress site with social media integration, SEO and custom print functionality for recipe cards. Modern illustrations and iconography were designed for her brand, and incorporated into the responsive site design and business cards. The beautiful <a class="bodyLink" href="http://salomefont.com/">Salom√© font</a> was used and modified for use in the logomark - I especially fell in love with the "it" ligature.</p>
