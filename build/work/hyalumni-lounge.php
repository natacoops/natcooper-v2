							<p>I had the pleasure of designing the online experience for the HackerYou Alumni Lounge. It is a simple web app that allows users to sign up for the lounge, and also provides administrators with an interface where they can easily manage member information.</p>
							<p>The design includes custom illustrations, iconography and UI elements. The original <a class="bodyLink" href="http://hackeryou.com/">HackerYou</a> branding - designed by the talented <a class="bodyLink" href="http://studiofunction.com/">Studio Function</a> team - inspired the overall modern, "flat" appearance.</p>
