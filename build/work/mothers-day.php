				<p>This Mother's Day app will generate recipes and a custom designed, printable greeting card for your Mom, based on what "kind" of Mom you consider her to be. There are 10 options to choose from, including a "Traditional" Mom, a "Disco Diva" Mom and "A Total Sweetheart" Mom.</p>
				<p>Based on your choice, appropriate recipes will be generated using a combination of criteria built into the Yummly API (which was used to power this project).</p>
				<p>This was a fun excuse to experiment with API integration and focus more on Front-End Development instead of strictly design. There's also a little countdown to Mother's Day included.</p>
