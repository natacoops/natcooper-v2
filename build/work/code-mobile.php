							<p>When <a class="bodyLink" href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a> asked me to design a truck for superheroes, I simply couldn't resist! This project provided me with the perfect excuse to design something bold, funky, and comic-book inspired - all while supporting a cause that is very close to my heart: teaching people (specifically women & kids) to code.</p>
							<p>Designing a large physical thing like a truck makes you think in a completely different way than if you were simply designing a flat product. I wanted people to enjoy engaging with the vehicle - so it features a speech bubble that makes the passengers seem like they are part of the design. Thereâ€™s also a blank computer screen that you can write on with erasable marker to update the number of learners that have been reached across Canada.</p>

							<p>I created a handful of different versions of the logo for various uses - including an embroidered badge, responsive website, stickers, apparel, signage and a branded tent.</p>
