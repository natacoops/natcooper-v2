						<p>I'm currently looking for my next full-time opportunity at a creative digital company. My ideal position would primarily involve design work with some coding / prototyping. I would also love any opportunity to work more with web animations, SVGs, or interaction design.</p>

						<p>My design program of choice is Adobe Illustrator, but I also love using Sketch for quick wireframing and brainstorming. I write code using Sublime Text, and usually write in Sass with a gulp.js build system. I love learning new programs and pick up on software very quickly.</p>

						<p>I look forward to opportunities where I can learn from senior designers and gain more industry experience.</p>
